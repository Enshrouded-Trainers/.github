# Enshrouded Trainer — When Survival Needs Room to Breathe

The fog in **Enshrouded** is not just weather.
It is pressure.
It is time running out.
It is the quiet reminder that the world does not wait.

This **Enshrouded Trainer** exists for moments when you want to *learn* the land instead of fighting it endlessly. It is not spectacle-driven, not noisy, not reckless. It is a careful set of levers—mechanical, reversible, precise—designed for PvE players who want freedom without destruction.

## 🌲 What Is the Enshrouded Trainer?

A trainer is a quiet instrument.

Unlike mod menus or overlays, this tool focuses on **value control**: health, stamina, cooldowns, resources, and movement parameters. It runs externally on Windows, attaches safely to the game process, and applies changes in real time—without touching save files.

Why players use it:

* Practice combat without constant death loops
* Explore Shroud zones calmly
* Test builds and skills without grinding
* Build and craft without resource walls

When closed, everything returns to normal. The world remembers nothing—but you do.

## 🛡 Player Survival & State Control

### ❤️ Core Survival Options

* God Mode (toggle on/off)
* Infinite health
* Infinite stamina

* No poison, no burn, no Shroud decay
* Temperature immunity (cold & heat)

These tools are ideal for deep exploration, boss learning, or long building sessions where interruption breaks immersion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All survival options can be activated independently—nothing is forced, nothing permanent.
